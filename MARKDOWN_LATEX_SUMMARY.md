## Demo Script (60 seconds)

```
"Our detector now displays analysis with professional formatting.
Notice how findings are organized with headers and lists, making
them easy to scan. Mathematical calculations are displayed with
proper LaTeX notation for accuracy.

[Show example analysis with formatted output]

This demonstrates not just analytical capability, but the ability
to communicate complex ideas clearly - essential for judging
misinformation."
